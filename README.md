# Chicken Coop V2
My Arduino sketch for my automated chicken coop.  The sketch offers a manual and automatic mode to close and open the door.

A standard photocell is used to detect sunrise and sunset.  I used part number 202403 from Jameco.com, the specifications are commented in my sketch.

The Sainsmart Dual H Bridge was used to control a 14 inch linear actuator which opens and closes the door.
